How do I set this up?
In Program - Line 16. you'll find "Discord Webhook" now create a webhook via your own discord server. 

1st: you will need to create a text channel.

2nd: head to that channels settings & find Integrations.

3rd: click "Create Webhook" name it whatever you'd like and copy the URL and paste it in the webhook section.

4th: Compile the Application, send it to your victim. Watch as your Victims Information fills your Webhook.

Goodluck :)
